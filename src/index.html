              Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture;
              and offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College
              students. Our website exists as an ongoing collaborative
              experiment in digital publishing and information sharing. It
              functions as a wikiâ€”all members of the School of Art community
              have the ability to add new, and edit most existing content.</span

              >Spring 2024 Visiting Artist lectures are happening primarily in
              person, with some guests joining us online via Zoom. Attendance
              for in-person lectures is limited to current members of the School
              of Art community. This page serves as an archive of those
              lectures, as well as the select clips and segments that may be
              made available on the School of Art's YouTube channel in the
              coming months, in collaboration with each guest. Internal
              recordings of these lectures (with recording at the discretion of
              each guest) are made available to School of Art students, faculty,
              and staff via Dropbox.</span

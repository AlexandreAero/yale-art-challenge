              The Yale Center for Environmental Justice is in the process of
              planning our fourth annual Global Environmental Justice
              Conference, with this year focusing on the theme of “Environmental
              Joy.” The conference aims to explore the ways in which
              environmental and climate justice and the communities engaged in
              that work generate joy. Guided by the notion that the ultimate
              goal of most environmental and climate work is to alleviate
              suffering and increase wellbeing, Environmental Joy will explore
              and celebrate the diverse ways that environmental justice achieves
              this goal. One facet of the conference programming we hope to
              organize is a juried art show soliciting works from artists around
              the world on the theme of Environmental Joy to be showcased in an
              exhibition during the conference. We are currently seeking any
              interested students or faculty who would be interested in
              supporting the planning and execution of this call for art. If
              you're interested in learning more about the opportunity, please
              contact Julia Simon at julia.simon@yale.edu.

              The Yale Arts Apprenticeship Program is an initiative that
              connects Yale undergraduates, particularly those on financial aid,
              with professional arts practitioners of any discipline. As an
              option within Yale's Summer Experience Award (SEA) funding model,
              the Arts Apprenticeship must fulfill the same basic requirements.
              Additional details, as well as those specific to the Arts
              Apprenticeship are included below. Yale faculty, alumni, or other
              arts practitioners interested in featuring positions through the
              program should contact Yale's Creative Careers advisor. Which
              Opportunities are Eligible? Must be at least 30 hours/week, for at
              least 8-weeks over the summer months. Those 8-weeks do not have to
              be continuous if the mentoring Arts Practitioner agrees on a
              different schedule. The time commitment need not all be in direct
              contact with the Arts Practitioner. Independent projects, tasks,
              research, etc. can comprise much of the experience, as long as the
              Arts Practitioner is checking in regularly with the student to
              provide oversight and career-based context. The opportunity cannot
              be with a for-profit organization. The engagement for an Arts
              Apprenticeship should be directly with an individual Arts
              Practitioner and not with a company. The only exception to this
              would be if the company overseeing the apprenticeship were a
              registered non-profit organization. For more information:
